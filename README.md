# CEOGAME Manager

A simple Python manager developed to aid the management of companies in CEOGAME.
It's premise is simple, whatever can be automated, will be automated at some point.

# Requirements

The requirements for the program to run without any errors are the following:

- [Python 3.X](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.0/python-3.10.0-amd64.exe)
- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) - Python package to handle HTTP requests

# Installation

After the [requirements](#requirements) are installed just execute the Python file using Python in the command line.

`python main.py` - Assuming filenames aren't changed

# Is this allowed?

Automations have been banned from games since the dawn of gaming as they provide a theoretical unfair advantage over other players, yet, as in the real world, automating your company is a step towards success, and therefore I see this tool as an actual **tool** to aid in your business' success.

The permission to use this program wasn't provided by _ceo@ceogame_ (Game Developer), so it's a use at your own risk feature.
