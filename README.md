# Is this allowed?

Automations have been banned from games since the dawn of gaming as they provide a theoretical unfair advantage over other players, yet, as in the real world, automating your company is a step towards success, and therefore I see this tool as an actual **tool** to aid in your business' success.

The permission to use this program wasn't provided by _ceo@ceogame_ (Game Developer), so it's a use at your own risk feature.
